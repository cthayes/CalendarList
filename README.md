## Features

- [x] Internationalized, localized reusable SwiftUI calendar view
- [x] Generic event data type
- [x] List representation of events for a given day
- [x] View generation for each event is handled by the parent view
- [x] Customizable styles for "today" and "selected" dates

## Usage

CalendarList takes two main arguments:

- Array of `CalendarEvent` elements. This type wraps the date for the event and the actual data you want to use. As long as the data comforms to the `Hashable` protocol, you can use any type you want.
- A`@ViewBuilder` block that will be used to generate the view that represents an event on a given day.

This is a very basic example using `String` as type for the data and a `Text` view to represent the event data:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var events = [
        CalendarEvent(dateString: "03/21/2020", data: "Event 1"),
        CalendarEvent(dateString: "03/23/2020", data: "Event 2"),
        CalendarEvent(dateString: "03/26/2020", data: "Event 3"),
        CalendarEvent(dateString: "03/26/2020", data: "Event 4"),
    ]
    
    var body: some View {
        CalendarList(events: self.events) { event in
            Text("\(event.data)")
        }
    }
}
```

This results in the following:
